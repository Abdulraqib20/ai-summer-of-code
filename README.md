## Pathway Options
The curriculum structure has been designed to be provide learners with the full dose of LLM application development. However, I understand that learners have different needs and preferences and some may want to focus on specific (and not all) areas. The curriculum structure can therefore be broken down into 3 recommended pathways - Applied AI, AI Engineering, and AI Foundations. This pathway design is optional and is by no means an absolute recommendation. My default recommendation is to follow all the modules in the curriculum, especially if you don't have a specific area of focus in mind.
